So to get recipient belonging to a user

use the logic used for getting menus by category for getting recipient in the users sending list

we can use tinker to find user (owner_id) with restaurants attached to this owner or belonging to this owner
$user = App\User::with('restaurants')->find(1);  // gets the owner with restaurants as id is passed to it i.e. id of the user
or
$user = App\User::with('restaurants')->get()  // to just get only the restaurants.
